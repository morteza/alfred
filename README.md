This repository contains some workflows I usually use, but made them before using those old Mac Services, Automator Workflows, and shit. I'm using Alfred now!

It's been a while that I'm using Alfred App; I like its short learning curve, developer and designer-friendly UX, and ease of use to develop your own workflow. Stuff here, in this repository, are my contributions to the productivity level of this app, limited by my own needs.
